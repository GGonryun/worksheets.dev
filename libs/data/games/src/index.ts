The player must use logic to figure out which squares to fill in and which to leave blank.</p><h3>Who created Nonograms?</h3><p>Nonograms were created by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli in 1987. The name "Nonogram" comes from the Japanese words "nō" (meaning "picture") and "gram" (meaning "puzzle").</p><h3>Why play Nonograms?</h3><p>Nonograms are a great way to pass the time. They are also a great way to exercise your brain. They can help improve your memory, concentration, and problem solving skills.</p><h3>Are Nonograms fun?</h3><p>Nonograms are fun if you like puzzles. If you don\'t like puzzles, then you probably won\'t like nonograms.</p><h3>Are Nonograms hard?</h3><p>Nonograms are not very hard. They are easy to learn but hard to master. The puzzles start off easy but get harder as you progress through the levels. There are lots of pictures to unlock so you will never run out of puzzles to solve.</p><h3>Controls</h3><ul><li>Click on the squares to fill them in or remove them</li></ul>',
