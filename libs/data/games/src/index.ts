The author of the first known solitaire rules was Lady Adelaide Cadogan, who wrote her rules in the late 1870s or early 1880s. Lady Cadogan's book was titled Illustrated Games of Patience and it was published in the United Kingdom in 1875. The book was very popular among the upper classes and eventually became known as The Solitaire Bible.</p><h3>Controls</h3><ul><li>Click and drag to move cards</li><li>Double click to move cards to the foundation</li><li>Click on the deck to draw cards</li></ul>`,

    description: `<h3>What is 1D Chess?</h3><p>The main idea is to make a simple strategy system for two equal sides fighting, which will give the player the opportunity to control the strength of each side, but at the same time the winning choice will not be pattern.</p><p>Chess pieces in their original quantity are ideal for this idea. They move abstractly correctly to the original game, and each piece is balanced equal to the other pieces.</p><p>Player control is limited to selecting one of a random three non-repeating pieces from a pool of 5 pieces. This way he can choose for each side, and defeat will be counted as soon as at least one figure reaches the opposite edge.</p><p>Next, a little about the logic of the game:</p><p>The board has 11 cells, and there are kings on the edges, that is, there are only 9 playable cells. All pieces have health and damage for smoother game play. The game is real time turn based, and the steps have the following logic: all pieces of the same color acts in a row, starting from the farthest to the last one created, their action can be either an attack or a movement, if a piece can hit, then it hits, if it cannot, then it tries to move forward on one cell, then the second color moves and so on alternating.</p><p>The Rogue-like system here is replaced by a special balance, which depends on the player's actions. You can feel what is making a difference in consider mistakes for future tries.</p><h3>How to Play 1D Chess?</h3><p>Select one of the three pieces for each side, and defeat will be counted as soon as at least one figure reaches the opposite edge.</p>`,

The player must use logic to figure out which squares to fill in and which to leave blank.</p><h3>Who created Nonograms?</h3><p>Nonograms were created by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli in 1987. The name "Nonogram" comes from the Japanese words "nō" (meaning "picture") and "gram" (meaning "puzzle").</p><h3>Why play Nonograms?</h3><p>Nonograms are a great way to pass the time. They are also a great way to exercise your brain. They can help improve your memory, concentration, and problem solving skills.</p><h3>Are Nonograms fun?</h3><p>Nonograms are fun if you like puzzles. If you don\'t like puzzles, then you probably won\'t like nonograms.</p><h3>Are Nonograms hard?</h3><p>Nonograms are not very hard. They are easy to learn but hard to master. The puzzles start off easy but get harder as you progress through the levels.

For each situation, it is necessary to choose the right strategy, based on where the enemy will come from, what another type are nearby, the equality of unit types, and the small abilities of the characters.</p><p>The player must only click on one of the three types of troops, which will be installed in a spiral behind the algorithm and create a compact group. Also, for convenience and better results, the player can examine the map to find out where the enemies will come from.</p><p>Very simple design so that as many units as possible are visible on the screen and are distinguishable.</p><p>The difficulty increases extremely quickly and on average one game takes 3 minutes.</p>`,
