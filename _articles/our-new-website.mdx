We've made major changes to improve our website's design and user experience. We hope you like it! If you're curious about what the site looked like before, jump to the end. We've been working on a new design for a while now, and we're excited to finally share it with you.

### Why did we change?

When we started this design we had a few goals in mind.

1. Increase the number of games on the platform.
2. Make it easier to find games you like.
3. Reducing the noise level.

#### Increasing the number of games

In order to increase the number of games we need help. There are only so many games we can code in-house. We want to encourage independent contributors to add their games to the platform. We've built developer pages to make it easier for developers to promote themselves. This is a great way to get more exposure for your games and get more players. You can add links to your website or social media accounts and customize your page with a banner and description. If you have a paid game on steam or itch, we provide widgets to show the price and a link.

#### Making it easier to find games

We've added a search bar, category pages, and improved recommendations. The search bar makes it easier to find games you're looking for. Our new game pages now show recommendations and similar games. The category pages also provide an easy way to find games you know you'll enjoy.

#### Reducing the noise level

The new design removes most of the text on the site and gets rid of the "newsletter" prompts. These prompts were really annoying and there are better platforms to share information about releases such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/Auatjee2BZ) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CharityGamesGo). We've also got a new logo and color scheme!

#### What's next?

People don't play games because they donate to charity, they play games because they are fun.

Our #1 priority for the next quarter is to deliver more games. We're working on a few games of our own, but we're also looking for more developers to contribute their own. You can host your games on our platform for free alongside your other websites. If you're interested in contributing, [contact us](/contact) or [join our discord](https://discord.gg/Auatjee2BZ).

Here's a sneak peak at what's on our roadmap for the next few months:

1. Transparency: show how much money we've raised and where it's going.
2. Advertisements: small unobtrusive ads to enable the charity donation system.
3. Optimizations: improve our websites loading times and performance, automate processes for game submissions.
4. User accounts: save your favorite games, track your donations, vote for your favorite games and more.
