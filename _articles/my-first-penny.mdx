This weeks image is from a hike I went on a few months ago with my sister in Denver, Colorado.

The stream of conciousness starts here.

## Insecurity

I spent most of 2023 working on ideas that never got off the ground. I don't think the ideas were bad. Both of them were essentially a Zapier clone but more focused on developers. The problem was I never had audience to share my work with. I was "building in public" but in a vacuum.

[Charity.Games](https://charity.games) is my first project that I'm actually trying to promote and share, (but all i'm using is my personal social media accounts).

I'd like to get more people to support my cause but it's hard for people to trust me when I don't have a track record of success. I know getting your first followers is the hardest part so I'm trying to be patient.

## Embarassment

I need to be less shy about sharing my work and more confident in the impact it can make. I've recently added a bunch of new games using a publisher but the games are low quality that it's embarassing to share. I'm not sure if I should just remove them or keep them up. I really want to work with independent creators and share their games. I think I'll just need to suck it up and start cold calling some indie devs asking if they'd like to share their games on my platform.

A lot of people ask me [if charity games is legit](https://www.charity.games/faq#i-do-not-trust-you). I suppose they're worried I'll generate a ton of revenue and run off with it. Rest assured, we're not making any profit. Actually, we only recently made our first penny.

This next year I'm going to actually register charity.games as a legit non-profit which should make it easier for people to trust me (although, I don't think people outside of the U.S.A. might know what a 501c is). At the end of this month I'll round up to the nearest $20 and donate it to [Water.Org](https://water.org).

For transparency here's more info about the revenue we've generated so far from adsense.

The amount of visitors and impressions I get on the site fluctuates depending on how hard I've been marketing the site. Honestly, just using social media and sharing my website isn't a great approach. I'd like to start working with more affiliates, streamers, game developers and really start pushing this thing.

## Hope

I had a few more ideas for how I can improve the platform. I've been thinking about making a marketplace for people to auction off old steam keys for games. The profit made from these auctions would go to charity. I'm not sure if it's a good idea but I think it's worth exploring.

This means that Charity.Games would get split into two parts. Maybe into sub domains like market.charity.games and arcade.charity.games. I'm not ready to build an entire marketplace, it would be a big undertaking for a solo-dev doing this as a hobby. In the mean time my goal is to get at least 50 games from independent contributors. From there I can start to think more about the auction house.

Looking forward to next week.
