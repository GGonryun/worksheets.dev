## Play Free Online Games from Your Browser

Hey gamers! We heard you loud and clear after binge-watching 100+ sessions. We just didn't have enough games! Most players came to our site and saw a empty catalog. We wanted to change that. We wanted to give you more options and more ways to donate to charity. So we've added a wide selection of games from our new partners. We hope you enjoy them!

## Play from any website

We've partnered with [Sidecade](https://sidecade.com/) to help raise money for charity. Sidecade is a platform that allows you to play games from your browser on **any** website! They have over 800+ games available; all you need to do is install a chrome extension. We've added a link to their website at the bottom of our home page and game pages. We hope you enjoy their games as much as we do!

## What's next?

Our goal for the next week is to grow the number of high quality games. We're looking for [independent contributors](/help?id=developer-help) who are building web games. If you know anyone who is building games, please let us know!
