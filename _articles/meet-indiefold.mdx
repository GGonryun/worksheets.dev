## Meet IndieFold

IndieFold makes it easy to create a portfolio, add games, and share it with the world. IndieFold is a great way to showcase your games and get feedback from the community. The [IndieFold community](https://indiefold.com/games?page=1) is constantly adding new games to their platform. You can claim your game by using the [Contact form](https://indiefold.com/contact) on the IndieFold website.

Indiefold is made for indie game devs to create a profile about themselves and their studio. Game publishers and developers can link their games and artwork to where they already exist on the web, that means Steam, Game Jolt, Itch, or other porfolio websites. IndieFold also helps content creators to find and share indie games to their audience.

### Creating a Portfolio

Creating a portfolio is easy, start off by setting up your profile. You can add a profile picture, a banner, and a description about yourself. You can also add your social media links, and a link to your website. Once you have your profile set up, you can start adding your games.
