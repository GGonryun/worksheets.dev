## What makes a good toilet game?

- TODO: Statistic about how many people play games on the toilet
- TODO: Statistic about frequency of pooping
- TODO: Statistic about the average time spent pooping
- TODO: Statistic about how many people have access to a toilet

No matter what kind of pooper you are, there are a few shared qualities we all desire in a great toilet game:

### Works on Mobile

- TODO: Statistic about how many people bring their phone to the bathroom

This is a hard requirement. You're probably not going to lug your laptop or gaming console into the bathroom so it has to be a game that works on your phone. There's also a good chance you're already bringing your phone into the bathroom with you, so it's the most convenient option.

  There's also a high chance that at some point during your toilet adventure you'll need to use your other hand. So games that require two hands will score lower on the list.

### No Installs

The game has to get set up quickly. No installing a new app otherwise you might beat the download time and not even get to play. It has to be a game that's already on your phone or a game that's easy to access. This is why we recommend playing a browser game. You can just open up a new tab and start playing. Browser games are quick and easy, hopefully, like your poop.

### Single Player

Coordinating your poop time with someone else's poop time can be a lot of work. Synchronizing your schedule might require having to careful balance your diet, sleep schedule, and in some cases, you may need a laxitive to get you both on the same page. It's just easier to play a single player game.

### A Simple Objective

- TODO: Statistics about the average game playtime on Steam, Mobile, Browser Games, and Console.

You can't play a game that requires intense focus, ideally the game supports some sort of turn based or pause-able gameplay. After you're done doing the deed, you'll need to be able to put the game down and wipe. This makes games like pinball and tetris a bad choice.

A high score mechanic will negatively affect the game's ranking on our list. High scores encourage continuous play and replayability which can be bad for your health. You don't want to be sitting on the toilet for too long.

It's better to have a game that includes levels or a clear end point. Games with levels offer great pausing opportunities and a clear end point. These games also give you something to look forward to the next time you're on the toilet. (Not that we're not already looking forward to it.)

### Short Sessions

- TODO: Statistic about how long people spend on the toilet

Regardless of how long it takes you to get business done in the bathroom, on average you'll only be there for a few minutes. Whatever game you play needs to deliver a satisfying experience in a short amount of time.

## Our favorite games to play while taking a dump

We'll take all of this into account when making our list. Each game will be rated on a scale of 1-5 for each of the above categories. The game with the highest score will be the best game to play while pooping.
