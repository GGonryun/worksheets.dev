title: I Spent $200 On 5 Games
excerpt: In the last 2 weeks I spent $200 on a few games mostly out of curiosity. I wanted to see what kind of games I could get and what the quality would be. I made a lot of mistakes this time around, but I learned a lot. I'm sharing my experience so you don't make the same mistakes I did.

## We spent $200 on 4 games

In the last 2 weeks I spent $200 on a few games mostly out of curiosity. Mostly to see what kind of games I could get but also to figure out what the quality would be.

I **strongly recommend** playing the games above before reading the rest of this article.

## The games

[Dino Rush](https://charity.games/play/dino-rush) cost $100 + $10 in assets. This game is an endless runner a lot like the google chrome one you see when you have no internet. The first deliverable had no menu, no instructions, no sounds, no music, and no way to restart the game. By the fourth review we managed to get these features added and felt like the game was ready to go.

[Plane Fly](https://charity.games/play/plane-fly) cost $70. $65 went to the freelancer and $5 went to purchasing assets. The game is a minimalistic flappy bird clone with a paper plane. The first deliverable had no animations, and the pipes that the plane ran into didn't even move. There was no sound, no menu, nothing juicy about it. The game doesn't get faster, and the controls are buggy and worst of all I didn't even get the source code on this one.

[Air Hockey Neon](https://charity.games/play/air-hockey-neon) cost $10. This game is basically air hockey. 0 complaints here, the game works as you'd expect on all devices and screen sizes. The game is exactly what I expected; no complaints.

[Stick Jump](https://charity.games/play/stick-jump) cost $8. This game is a stick figure that jumps from platform to platform. The game is a clone of doodle jump. The game works on all devices and screen orientations as expected. Again, no complaints.

[Freedom Run](https://charity.games/play/freedom-run) cost $2 for assets. This game I made myself using Construct 3. I spent about 10 hours on this game over a weekend because I was bored. The game is also an endless runner, it has all the same features as the other two games but with a much better user interface and less bugs.

## What I learned?

#### Be clear about your goals and expectations up front.

My first mistake was not being explicit about my goals. I asked the freelancers: "Hey, what can I get with $60?". Sadly, of the 6 I reached out to all of them said the same thing: "an endless runner". I was hoping for something more creative, but I guess that's what you get for $60 and no prompt.

It also took us a lot of iterating because the freelancers did not expect that a game should include sound effects, and a user interface explaining how the game works. If I had just been clearer about this upfront we would have saved a lot of time and received the games earlier.

#### Have your own assets ready to go.

Freelancers aren't going to create assets for you. Most of them don't have _all_ the skills required to make a video game. You'll end up getting a game that mixes together random free assets or random purchased assets if you go find them. This means it's a lot harder to coordinate the final product because if you're freelancing you'll need to have a clear design vision and game play vision up front.

The [Plane Fly](https://charity.games/play/plane-fly) was the worst case of this because the free assets the freelancer used were not even the same style **and**, to add insult to injury, the background buildings contain profanity. I should have warned them about this but I made a huge mistake, probably the biggest of all.

#### Playtest the game before approving the order.

Seriously, I can't believe I fell for this one. The problem here was that I was traveling for an onsite event my employeer was hosting and I was in a rush to just get the final games uploaded onto [Charity.Games](https://charity.games/). So I approved them without playing them first, **big mistake**. The [Dino Rush](https://charity.games/play/dino-rush) was the primary culprit, this game was hardly playable on mobile when I finally got to play it. I spent an additional 5 hours debugging the game, learning unity and fixing the errors.

The other games that I purchased from Code Canyon were fine. I was allowed to play-test them before I paid. I should have done the same with the freelancers.

#### Low code alternatives are a great way to get started.

I _love_ [construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en). It's a low-code or no-code alternative to creating video games that runs in your browser and works offline! It saves me a ton of time because it already comes with a lot of the features I need to make a game. I can focus on the game play and not the technical details. _Well_, there's a downside to this. I'm a programmer! I love the technical details, and I essentially got rid of the part I was good at. In the end I spent the same amount of time trying to find the correct assets or making slight changes to them on photoshop in order to release a coherent game [Freedom Run](https://charity.games/play/freedom-run).

#### You get what you pay for.

I really went with the bottom of the barrel here. I wanted to see what I could get for less than $100 and the results are dissapointing. At the very least I have some more content for my website and maybe I'll recuperate the costs in the long run (but I doubt it). Freelancers are trying to do the least amount of work the same way I was trying to pay as little as possible. I don't blame them. I blame myself for not being clear about my expectations and goals.

## Would I do this again?

No. I would not do this again. I would rather work with independent developers and pay them a fair wage to create games for [Charity.Games](https://charity.games/). If you're a game developer and want to donate a game to [Charity.Games](https://charity.games/) please reach out to me on twitter or via email. I'd love to work with you.
