## The Impact Of Gaming On Charity

Over a [quarter of American adults believe that video games are a complete waste of time](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CVideo%20games%20are%20a%20waste,and%2016%25%20are%20not%20sure.). Video games are often [associated with violence, addiction, and laziness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9856521/). To add insult to injury, a study in [2020 found that there was no significant evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8870796/) to support the idea that video games improve problem solving skills. Coming hot off the heels of a global pandemic which forced most of the world to stay indoors, video games have become a life line for many people. Sometimes, this [life line can become an addiction or a disorder](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1230774/full).

<center>It's okay buddy, we get it</center>

Despite the negative reviews, year after year, the gaming industry keeps going, and with it, it's image is improving. Proponents of gaming frequently cite that video games help [people think quickly](https://www.uvpediatrics.com/topics/video-games-pros-and-cons/), [improve mental health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978245/) and [foster our social skills](https://living.geico.com/home/technology/9-reasons-to-give-video-games-a-try/#:~:text=Past%20research%20involving%20children%20found,to%20some%20types%20of%20games.). We'd like to focus on another aspect of gaming that is often overlooked, the impact of gaming on charity.

Consumers of video games and the industry itself often collaborate in unique ways to support charitable causes. This has led to a significant impact on the world of charity. In 2022, Americans donated an incredible [$499.33 billion dollars to charitable causes](https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/why-americans-donate-what-motivates-people-to-give-and-what-causes-do-they-give-to/#:~:text=And%20in%202022%2C%20Americans%20were,of%20that%20giving%3A%20%2421.08%20billion.). Less than 5% of the American contribution to charity came from corporations, which only donated a measly $22 billion compared to their profits that year. The fortune 500 recorded a record-high [aggregate revenue of about $41 trillion in 2022](https://fortune.com/ranking/global500/). The vast majority of donations came from individuals, foundations, and bequests.

Astonishingly, the total sum of money donated by Americans eclipses the entire [$97.67 billion dollar market size of the gaming industry in 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20video%20game,new%20all%2Dtime%20industry%20record.). Even though the market size of the gaming industry is four times smaller than the charitable giving industry, it has found a way to make a significant impact on the world of charity.

The Humble Bundle has raised over [$250 million dollars for charity](https://www.humblebundle.com/charities) if you add up it's total lifetime contributions. On January of this year, the [Awesome Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/event/AGDQ2024) marathon raised over $2.5 million dollars, and [the year before it raised over $2.6 million](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/event/AGDQ2023), far exceeding their [first marathon in 2010 which raised $10,000](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/event/cgdq). Even more recently, and on a smaller scale, the [Safe in Our World Charity Bundle](https://safeinourworld.org/news/safe-in-our-world-charity-bundle-2024-sold-out-raising-200000/) on [Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com/en/) raised over $200,000. The bundle sold out in record time, and the proceeds went to support mental health awareness.

We believe that the gaming industry can have a significant impact on the world of charity through it's unique ability to bring people who don't normally donate to charity together to support a cause.

We're here to highlight, share, and present the origin stories of 13 charities using gaming to make a difference in the world.

Charity Games is a community of developers, designers, artists, musicians, and gamers united by a common goal: using the power of gaming to create a positive impact on the world. Charity Games has built an online arcade dedicated to creating fun and free browser games that help support charitable causes.

Charity Games is the youngest organization on this list. Charity Games' first game released in October of 2023 by [Miguel Campos](https://charity.games/about) who was getting sick and tired of all the advertisements and microtransactions in mobile games. He was inspired by games like [Free Rice](https://freerice.com/) to create a platform that allowed people to play games and help people in need. The goal was to create a platform which let anyone donate to charity without spending a single penny while also having fun.

He started by building a simple game that generated water for people in need called [Puzzle Words](https://charity.games/play/puzzle-words) while on a flight from San Diego to New York. The game was a hit, and it generated over 2,000 liters of water in the first month. Since then, [Charity Games has grown to include over 30 games](https://charity.games/play) thanks to [independent contributions from developers](https://charity.games/help/developers) around the world.
