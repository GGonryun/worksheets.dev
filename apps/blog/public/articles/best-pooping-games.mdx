## Pooping Facts

The average bowel movement [takes 12 seconds](https://www.geisinger.org/health-and-wellness/wellness-articles/2017/10/27/15/44/poop-or-get-off-the-potty#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20the,10%20minutes%20on%20the%20toilet), but on rare occasions it can take up to 10 minutes. When it does, you want to make sure you've got something to do. [Most people will spend 92 days of their lives on the toilet](https://portlandloo.com/how-much-of-your-life-is-spent-going-plus-other-fascinating-and-frightening-toilet-facts/#:~:text=People%20will%20spend%2092%20days%20of%20their%20lives%20on%20the%20toilet.&text=As%20it%20turns%20out%2C%20you,their%20phone%20to%20the%20bathroom.). According to a [study done by NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/blog/staying-busy-when-nature-calls-smartphone-use-on-the-toilet/#:~:text=If%20you%20take%20your%20smartphone,with%20them%20to%20the%20loo.), over 65% of their survey respondents take their smartphone with them into the restroom. If you're in the bathroom with your phone, what are you doing?

[Over 60% of people read books, magazines, and newspapers while in the bathroom](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bathroom-habits_n_4987018#:~:text=Literacy%20lovers%20should%20enjoy%20this,that%20one%20coming%2C%20right?). Although there's a good chance that these two groups overlap, it's more likely that younger generations with phones in the bathroom are scrolling through social media. The average person spends over 2 hours on social media every day, and most poopers are probably doomscrolling through their Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook feeds. We're here to offer a more entertaining alternative to doom scrolling on your phone. Play a game! No matter what kind of pooper you are we've got you covered. Here are a few shared qualities we all desire in a great toilet game:

## What makes a good toilet game?

Much like our bowel movements, we want games to be easy, fast, and distraction free. Being distracted during the process of defecating can have adverse effects. Being distracted can result in excessive straining which can be bad for you, and therefore it's recommended that we spend no more than 10 minutes on the toilet, [Dr. Venayagamurthy shares](https://www.columbiaasia.com/malaysia/health-articles/why-reading-toilet-bad-you#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20defecation%20in,prolonged%20defecation%20or%20excessive%20straining.). If you find yourself spending too much time on the toilet, you might need to get more fibre in your diet. You should definitely consult with a medical professional if a bowel movement lasts long enough to beat [Act 1 of Baldur's Gate](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15n6xio/how_much_time_did_it_take_you_to_finish_act_1/).

No matter what kind of pooper you are, there are a few shared qualities we all desire in a great toilet game.

### 1. It works on your phone

Even though [88% of people say it's normal to use your laptop while on the toilet](https://www.isitnormal.com/post/is-it-normal-to-use-my-laptop-while-on-the-toilet--37452.html), it's a lot of work and it's probably going to interrupt your ideal session. We'll stick to mobile games since there's [a good chance you're already bringing your phone into the bathroom](https://nordvpn.com/blog/staying-busy-when-nature-calls-smartphone-use-on-the-toilet/#:~:text=65%%20of%20all%20respondents%20said%20they%20take%20it%20with%20them%20to%20the%20loo) with you.

Don't forget to sanitize your phone from time to time as it'll collect a lot of fecal bacteria everytime you bring it to the bathroom with you. A cellphone can have [10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat](https://saniprofessional.com/how-dirty-is-your-cell-phone/)!

### 2. Don't waste precious time installing an app

We'll exclude any game that requires an app install because you might finish your toilet session before the app download finishes which means you won't get to play.

The world wide average internet speed was [7.2 megabits per second in 2017](https://www.fastmetrics.com/internet-connection-speed-by-country.php), and in the U.S.A. the average speed was over [227 megabits per second in 2024](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/us-internet-speeds-globally). On the downside, there has recently been a surge in storage requirements since the average size of the [app store's top games in 2020 were 465 megabytes](https://sensortower.com/blog/ios-game-size-growth-2020)! If you're lucky then downloading an app store game takes you around 20 seconds, but if you're unlucky with [internet speeds of 50 megabits per second](https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/download-time) you could be waiting for over a minute!

  I'd rather read a privacy policy than wait for a game to install.

### 3. Don't rely on other people

Coordinating your poop time with someone else's poop time can be a lot of work. Synchronizing your schedule might require having to careful balance your diet, sleep schedule, and in some cases, you may need a laxitive to get you both on the same page. It's just easier to play a single player game.

This isn't a hard requirement, because maybe you're lucky and you've got a friend who poops at the same time as you. Most people [poop in the morning after waking up or after breakfast](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/#:~:text=Most%20people%20poop%20once%20or,normal%20stool%2C%20confirms%20William%20W.). You might need to sync up your alarm clocks to get the most out of this.

### 4. Have fun, make it easy, and make it quick.

The longer you sit on the toilet, [the more stress and strain you're putting on your butt and legs](https://nypost.com/2016/08/25/sorry-to-ruin-your-day-but-reading-on-the-toilet-is-bad-for-you/), which inadvertently can restrict blood flow leading to more complications. We want to make sure that the experience is as enjoyable as possible.

Make those games easy to play and make the average session short. Games that require a high score mechanic might have you sitting on the toilet much longer than you'd expect.

It's better to have a game that includes levels or a clear end point. Games with levels offer great pausing opportunities and a clear end point for your session. These games also give you something to look forward to the next time you're on the toilet.

## Pooping Time = Charity Time

At the beginning of the article we mentioned that most people will spend 3 months of their lives on the toilet. This statistic only holds true if you're one of the lucky [4.6 billion people with access to a](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sanitation#:~:text=Key%20facts,as%20private%20toilets%20or%20latrines.) safely managed sanitation service. Which is further complicated by the fact that [only three-quarters of the world](https://ourworldindata.org/clean-water#:~:text=Almost%20three%2Dquarters%20of%20the,a%20safe%20drinking%20water%20source.) has access to safely managed water source. At Charity Games we want to make a difference, using browser gaming and digital prizes as incentive to get people to make the world a better place.

Charity Games aims to convert your pooping time into charity time. We use advertisement revenue, generated when you play games on our platform, to support charities like [Water.org](https://water.org/) and [Charity: Water](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/the-spring?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=donor-acq-usrow&utm_term=cBC_CW_G_PAID_SEARCH_BRAND_ALL_US+ROW_TROAS_ALL_EXACT_ALL&utm_medium=paid-ppc&utm_content=branded&gad_source=1). Both are organizations who are on a mission to bring water and sanitation to the world.

Help us make the world a better place, one toilet session at a time. [Learn more about our mission](https://charity.games/about).
