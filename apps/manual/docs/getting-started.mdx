[Worksheets.dev](https://worksheets.dev) is a low-code integration platform built for developers to integrate applications into their code without having to learn the APIs or SDKs of those applications.

- Static typesafety for all applications and their inputs and outputs
- No more dependency hell, use one light-weight SDK for all applications.
- Instant analytics and insights for your application usage on [Worksheets.dev](https://worksheets.dev)

clicking on the "Get API Key" button on the top right corner of the page. You will need to provide a name for your API key. Once you have created an API key, you will be able to see it on the API Keys page. You can copy the API key by clicking on the copy button next to the API key.

### Using the SDK

- Note: we currently only support Typescript.
  ![SDK Example](/img/worksheets-basic-640.gif)

#### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @worksheets/sdk
```

#### Import the SDK

```typescript
import { newRegistry } from '@worksheets/sdk';
```

#### Initialize the SDK

```typescript
const apps = newRegistry({
  credentials: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
});
```

- Optional parameters for debugging and development

```typescript
const apps = newRegistry({
  credentials: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
  logging: "verbose" // enable verbose logging before sending requests.
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:420/v1', // use a local server for development
  // if present, intercepts all calls before they are sent to our servers.
  interceptor(request){
    console.log(request.app, request.method, request.contex, request.input)
  }
});
```

#### Call an application

```typescript
apps
  .math()
  .calc({
    op: '*'
    x: 2,
    y: 3,
  }).then((result) => {
    console.log(result)
  })
```
