# What is Worksheets.dev?

Worksheets.dev is a low code automation platform built to help developers streamline complex multi-application workflows. Our platform provides a simple API for integrating with applications, executing your workflows, and managing secure credentials. With our simple API, you can build your own custom integrations in minutes.

- Worksheets uses a YAML syntax to describe your workflows enabling quick integration with any project. Our [OpenAPI specification file](/docs/open-api) allows you to autogenerate client libraries for your favorite programming language.
- Quickly connect with our growing list of applications. Don't integrate with the same apps over and over again across your projects. Let us handle the busy work so you can focus on building new applications with speed.
- OAuth is complicated but connecting to your favorite applications shouldn't be. Worksheets handles the OAuth flow for you making it easy to connect to your favorite applications with ease.
