# What is Worksheets.dev?

Worksheets.dev is a low code automation platform built to help developers quickly connect and serve complex multi-application workflows. Our platform provides a simple API for integrating with external applications, executing long-running workflows, and managing secure credentials.

- Worksheets uses a **YAML syntax** to describe your workflows enabling quick integration with any project. Our [OpenAPI specification file](/docs/api/overview#open-api) allows you to autogenerate client libraries for your favorite programming language.
- Quickly connect with our growing list of **applications**. Don't integrate with the same apps over and over again across your projects. Let us handle the busy work so you can focus on building new services with speed.
- **OAuth** is complicated but connecting to your favorite applications shouldn't be. Worksheets handles the OAuth flow for you making it easy to connect to your favorite applications with ease.
