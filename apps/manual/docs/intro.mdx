# What is Worksheets.dev?

Worksheets.dev is a low-code integration platform built for developers. We provide a simple TypeScript SDK that developers can use to integrate applications into their code without having to learn the APIs or SDKs of those applications.

# Why Worksheets.dev?

Modern software integrates with hundreds of applications. Working within these ecosystems can be challenging because:

- Developers have to maintain hundreds of packages and when their dependencies become insecure these vulnerabilities also become a part of their codebase.

- Developers have to learn the APIs and SDKs of each application they want to integrate with. This can be time consuming and can lead to errors.

- Developers have to instrument their code to handle the different APIs and SDKs of each application. This can lead to a lot of boilerplate code.

Worksheets.dev solves this problem by providing a single typescript SDK with full static type safety that can be used to integrate with any application.

## How does it work?

![SDK Example](/img/worksheets-basic-640.gif)

Our SDK acts as a proxy for your requests and forwards it to our servers. Our server's take care of routing the request to the appropriate application and returning the response back to you. We never store any of your data on our servers.

## Quick Start

For a more indepth guide refer to our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

To get started, you need to install the worksheets.dev SDK. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @worksheets-dev/sdk
```

Our SDK works best with React and Next.js projects but it can be used with any TypeScript 5.0.0+ project.

Here is an example of how you can use the worksheets.dev SDK to integrate with [Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).

```typescript
import { newRegistry } from '@worksheets/sdk';

const registry = newRegistry({
  credentials: 'YOUR_WORKSHEET_API_KEY',
});

const openai = registry.openai({ apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' });

const response = await openai.completions.create({
  model: 'text-davinci-003',
  prompt: 'Say this is a test',
  max_tokens: 7,
  temperature: 0,
});

console.log(response.choices);
/*
[
  {
    "text": "\n\nThis is indeed a test",
    "index": 0,
    "logprobs": null,
    "finish_reason": "length"
  }
]
*/
```
