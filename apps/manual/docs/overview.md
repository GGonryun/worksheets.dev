# Overview

Worksheets is a low code integration platform that allows you to connect to any API, database, or service. We provide two primary abstractions for integrating with other services: **Applications** and **Worksheets**. **Applications** contain the logic for interacting with a specific external system, and **Worksheets** contain the logic for orchestrating the execution of one or more Applications. Let's take a look at applications first.

## Applications

Every application includes several service **methods**. Each method encapsulates a unit of work. A **unit of work** can be anything from simple json manipulation, calling an external API, or requesting human interaction. Applications are designed to be reusable and can be shared across multiple worksheets. We provide a set of [pre-built applications](https://app.worksheets.dev/applications) that you can use out of the box, but you can also create your own custom applications using our [Application-SDK](/docs/advanced/application-sdk).
