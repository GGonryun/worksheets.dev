# Frequently Asked Questions

## What applications do you connect with?

- A sample list of applications can be found at our [Application Gallery](https://worksheets.dev/applications)
- We're actively growing our list of applications. If you want to request an app, please [contact us](/contact-us).

## How does the platform work?

- The platform acts as an application proxy. We provide a light weight SDK so that you can easily access the APIs of your favorite applications. These requests are sent to our servers where we send the request to the application on your behalf. This means that you don't have to worry about managing dependencies for each SDK.

## What happens to my credentials when I connect an application?

- You are in charge of storing and securing access tokens to your applications. We currently do not store any of your credentials. We only use them to make API calls on your behalf through our platform. In the future we plan to add support for token storage and authentication providers such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

## What happens to my data?

- We don't record any of your data. We only record whether or not your execution was successful. If you want to have all of your information deleted, please [contact us](/contact-us).

## What languages do you support?

- We only support TypeScript. This is what enables us to provide a low-code experience. We plan to add support for other languages in the future. If you want to make API requests to our platform, you can use any language that supports HTTP requests and our openapi spec. We are actively working on our HTTP API guide.
